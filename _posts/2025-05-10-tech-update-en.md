## 🔹 Kubernetes - Kubernetes v1.33: Streaming List responses
The blog post discusses a new feature in Kubernetes v1.33 that introduces streaming encoding for List responses, which addresses the challenge of unnecessary memory consumption when handling large datasets in Kubernetes clusters. Previously, large List requests could significantly impact cluster stability due to high memory usage, potentially leading to Out-of-Memory (OOM) situations. The new streaming encoding mechanism processes and transmits each item in a List response individually, allowing memory to be freed progressively. This approach reduces the memory footprint of the API server, improves scalability, increases stability, and optimizes resource utilization. Benchmark results show a 20x improvement in memory usage, reducing it from 70-80GB to 3GB during large List operations. The change is backward compatible, requiring no modifications on the client side.

## 🔹 Docker - Securing Model Context Protocol: Safer Agentic AI with Containers
The blog post discusses the growing adoption of Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools and the accompanying security concerns. As MCP tools allow for greater agent autonomy, they introduce risks such as misalignment between agent behavior and user expectations, as well as issues with uncontrolled execution. The article emphasizes the need for improved security measures to address these challenges as MCP tools become more widely used.
