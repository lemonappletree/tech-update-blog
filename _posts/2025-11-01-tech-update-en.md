## üîπ Kubernetes - 7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)
The blog post discusses seven common pitfalls in Kubernetes usage and provides tips on how to avoid them. The author shares personal experiences with these issues, aiming to help readers, whether they are new to Kubernetes or managing production clusters, avoid similar mistakes. The pitfalls include: 

1. **Skipping Resource Requests and Limits**: Not setting CPU and memory requirements can lead to resource starvation or hoarding.
2. **Underestimating Liveness and Readiness Probes**: Failing to define health checks can cause issues if a container is unresponsive or not ready.
3. **Relying Solely on Container Logs**: Using only `kubectl logs` can lead to lost logs, so centralizing logs is recommended.
4. **Treating Dev and Prod the Same**: Using identical settings across environments can lead to instability; customization is crucial.
5. **Leaving Old Resources Around**: Forgotten resources can consume resources and increase costs, so regular audits and labeling are important.
6. **Diving Too Deep into Networking Too Soon**: Advanced networking solutions should only be added once core networking is understood.
7. **Going Too Light on Security and RBAC**: Insecure configurations pose risks; using RBAC and security policies is essential.

The post concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding Kubernetes deeply and learning from mistakes to improve cluster management.
