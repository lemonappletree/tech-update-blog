Users are advised to migrate to alternatives such as the Gateway API, the modern replacement for Ingress, or other Ingress controllers listed in Kubernetes documentation. The retirement decision is due to maintenance challenges and changing expectations in cloud-native software, despite Ingress NGINX's popularity and extensive use. The post acknowledges the dedication of its maintainers and urges users to begin migration immediately to ensure continued safety and security.
