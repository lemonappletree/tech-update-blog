# 🛠️ 2025-06-17 Tech Update Summary

## 🔹 Kubernetes - Changes to Kubernetes Slack
The Kubernetes Slack will transition from a customized enterprise account to a standard free version on June 20. This change results from Slack's decision to stop supporting the large and active Kubernetes community with a free enterprise account. Consequently, the community will face limitations such as retaining only 90 days of message history and disabling certain apps and workflows. Community members responsible for channels or part of User Groups need to take action to prepare for these changes. The CNCF Projects Staff has proposed migrating to Discord, which offers new tools and integrations like GitHub group membership synchronization. The Steering Committee will decide on the new platform. For updates and further information, members can refer to the FAQ, mailing list, and relevant channels. Feedback can be shared through a GitHub discussion.
