## 🔹 Kubernetes - Introducing Headlamp Plugin for Karpenter - Scaling and Visibility
The blog post introduces the Headlamp Karpenter Plugin, which enhances the Headlamp UI by providing real-time visibility into Karpenter, a Kubernetes autoscaling project. This plugin helps users understand, debug, and optimize autoscaling by displaying the relationship between Karpenter and Kubernetes resources, live metrics, and scaling events. Users can inspect pending pods, review scaling decisions, and edit configurations with validation support. It includes features like a map view of resources, metrics visualization, scaling decisions insights, and a real-time view of Karpenter resources. The plugin is tested with AWS and Azure providers, with other providers requiring further testing. Users are encouraged to provide feedback and contribute to the project.

## 🔹 Spring Boot - Introducing Share Consumer Support (Kafka Queues) in Spring for Apache Kafka
The blog post introduces Share Consumer Support, also known as Kafka Queues, in Spring for Apache Kafka 4.0.0, coinciding with the Apache Kafka 4.0.0 release. This new feature offers an alternative consumption model to traditional consumer groups, focusing on record-level distribution rather than partition-level assignment. This is particularly useful for processing high volumes of independent events where sequence is not crucial, allowing for better scaling and flexibility. Share Groups allow dynamic scaling without the need for numerous partitions, which is beneficial for workloads with fluctuating demand. The blog provides insights into when to use Share Groups versus traditional consumer groups, explains the mechanics of Share Groups, and offers guidance on setting them up in Spring. It highlights the advantages of Share Groups in improving throughput and scaling, while maintaining consistency with existing Spring for Apache Kafka models. The feature is currently in preview and expected to be production-ready in Kafka 4.2.0. The post encourages users to explore this new feature and provide feedback for further improvements.

## 🔹 Docker - Build a Multi-Agent System in 5 Minutes with cagent
The tech blog post discusses the rapid advancement of AI models like GPT-5, Claude Sonnet, and Gemini, highlighting that while these models offer increased capabilities, solving complex tasks often requires more than just a single model. Developers are starting to recognize the need for multi-agent systems, where different types of agents collaborate to accomplish various tasks. For example, having one agent to conduct research and another to summarize information. The post likely provides guidance on how to quickly build such a system using "cagent."
