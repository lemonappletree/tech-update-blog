## 🔹 Kubernetes - Kubernetes v1.34: Pods Report DRA Resource Health
The blog post discusses the new alpha feature in Kubernetes v1.34 that enhances visibility into the health of specialized hardware like GPUs, TPUs, and FPGAs used in Kubernetes clusters. This feature extends the capabilities of KEP-4680, allowing Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) drivers to report device health directly into a Pod's status field, helping operators and developers diagnose hardware issues quickly. It introduces a gRPC health service for DRA drivers to stream device health updates to the Kubelet, which then updates the Pod status to reflect changes in device health. The feature is currently in alpha, requiring enabling the `ResourceHealthStatus` feature gate and using compatible DRA drivers. Future plans include adding detailed health messages, configurable health timeouts, and improved troubleshooting for terminated pods. Feedback from the community is sought for further improvements.
