## 🔹 Spring Boot - Towards Spring Tools 5 - Stereotypes and a new Structural View
The blog post discusses enhancements in Spring Tools 5, focusing on the integration of higher-level concepts like stereotypes and a new structural view for Spring projects. Traditionally, Spring Tools provided navigation and overviews using specialized symbols for Spring concepts like services and repositories. The new release enhances this by integrating with jMolecules 2.0 to offer a logical structure view that groups project elements by stereotypes, improving visualization and navigation. This view allows customization to display specific stereotypes and integrates with Spring Modulith for projects defining modular structures. Additionally, developers can define custom stereotypes via metadata or annotations. The post concludes by inviting users to try the latest release candidates and mentions future topics, including AI coding assistant integration.

## 🔹 Docker - You Want Microservices, But Do You Really Need Them?
The blog post discusses a significant shift by Amazon in May 2023, where the company decided to replace its Prime Video microservices architecture with a monolithic one, resulting in a 90% cost reduction. This move is notable because Amazon, which profits significantly from selling microservices infrastructure through AWS, acknowledged that a monolithic architecture can be more efficient in certain cases. The post questions the necessity of microservices for all projects and suggests reconsidering them in favor of simpler solutions like monoliths, depending on specific needs and contexts.

While the default collector, G1, is generally a good option, other collectors might offer superior performance for specific use cases. The post includes a video that covers the fundamentals of garbage collection, reasons for having multiple collectors, the main features of G1 and ZGC, and the performance differences among collectors and different JDK versions.
