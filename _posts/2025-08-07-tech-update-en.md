## üîπ Docker - Accelerating FedRAMP Compliance with Docker Hardened Images
The blog post discusses the challenges and costs associated with achieving FedRAMP compliance, which can range from $450,000 to over $2 million and take 12 to 18 months. This lengthy process can put companies at a disadvantage as competitors may capture government contracts during this time. Companies need to configure FIPS cryptography, harden security baselines, and manage over 400 security controls. The post highlights how using Docker hardened images can accelerate the FedRAMP compliance process, potentially reducing the time and resources needed to achieve this certification, thereby enabling companies to compete more effectively for government contracts.

## üîπ Golang - The FIPS 140-3 Go Cryptographic Module
The blog post discusses the introduction of a FIPS 140-3 compliant cryptographic module in the Go programming language. This new feature allows Go developers to use cryptographic functions that meet the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-3 requirements, which are important for ensuring security and compliance in government and regulated industries. By integrating this mode natively, Go aims to provide developers with a reliable and secure way to implement cryptographic operations without needing third-party libraries or external validation processes. This enhancement simplifies the process of achieving FIPS compliance for applications developed in Go.
