## 🔹 Kubernetes - Kubernetes v1.33: In-Place Pod Resize Graduated to Beta
The blog post announces that the in-place Pod resize feature in Kubernetes, which allows CPU and memory resources to be adjusted for running containers without needing a restart, has graduated to Beta and will be enabled by default in Kubernetes v1.33. This advancement enhances resource management by reducing disruption, improving resource utilization, and enabling faster scaling. Since its alpha release in v1.27, the feature has undergone significant improvements, including user-facing changes such as the introduction of a `resize` subresource, better status reporting, and support for resizing sidecar containers. Stability and reliability have been enhanced through refined resource management, improved checkpointing, and faster resize detection. The next steps include further stabilization, addressing limitations, integrating with VerticalPodAutoscaler, and gathering user feedback. Users can start experimenting with this feature in v1.33 and are encouraged to provide feedback through Kubernetes communication channels.
