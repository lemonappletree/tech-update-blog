## 🔹 Kubernetes - Introducing Headlamp Plugin for Karpenter - Scaling and Visibility
The blog post introduces the new Headlamp Karpenter Plugin, which enhances the Headlamp UI by offering real-time visibility into Karpenter's autoscaling activities within Kubernetes clusters. The plugin allows users to see the relationships between Karpenter and Kubernetes resources, visualize live metrics, and track scaling events as they occur. Users can inspect pending pods, review scaling decisions, and edit Karpenter-managed resources with built-in validation. The plugin aims to help Kubernetes users and operators better understand and optimize autoscaling behaviors. It supports AWS and Azure providers and invites users to test other providers or contribute to its development. Instructions for use and feedback channels are also provided.
