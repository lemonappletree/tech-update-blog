## 🔹 Kubernetes - Kubernetes v1.33: Streaming List responses
The blog post discusses the release of Kubernetes v1.33, which introduces streaming encoding for List responses, addressing the challenge of unnecessary memory consumption when handling large-scale List requests in Kubernetes clusters. Previously, the entire response was serialized into one memory block, causing high memory usage and potential stability issues. The new streaming encoder processes and transmits each item individually, allowing for progressive memory freeing and reducing the memory footprint of the API server. This change enhances cluster stability, scalability, and resource utilization. Benchmark results show a significant reduction in memory usage, improving from 70-80GB to 3GB when handling large requests. The streaming encoder is fully backward compatible, requiring no changes from the client side.

## 🔹 Docker - Securing Model Context Protocol: Safer Agentic AI with Containers
The blog post discusses the growing adoption of Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, which are primarily used by early adopters but are spreading more widely. As their use increases, security concerns related to MCP tools are becoming more pressing. The blog highlights that while these tools enhance agent autonomy, they also introduce risks such as misalignment between agent behavior and user expectations, as well as the potential for uncontrolled execution. The post suggests that these systems present new challenges in maintaining security and ensuring safe interactions between users and AI agents.
