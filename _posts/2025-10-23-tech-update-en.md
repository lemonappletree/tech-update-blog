## üîπ Kubernetes - 7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)
The blog post titled "7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)" discusses frequent challenges encountered when working with Kubernetes and offers strategies to circumvent them. The author shares personal experiences and insights to help others avoid similar issues. Key pitfalls include:

1. **Skipping Resource Requests and Limits**: Not setting CPU and memory specifications can lead to resource starvation or hoarding.
2. **Underestimating Liveness and Readiness Probes**: Without health checks, Kubernetes might misinterpret a container's status, leading to traffic reaching unprepared services.
3. **Relying Solely on Container Logs**: Sole reliance on `kubectl logs` can result in lost logs after container deletion; centralizing logs is recommended.
4. **Treating Dev and Prod Identically**: Identical setups across environments can cause performance and security issues due to differing requirements.
5. **Leaving Old Resources Running**: Unused resources can accumulate, wasting resources and increasing costs.
6. **Diving Too Deep Into Networking Too Soon**: Advanced networking solutions should follow a thorough understanding of Kubernetes' native networking.
7. **Neglecting Security and RBAC**: Insecure configurations and overly broad permissions can expose clusters to security vulnerabilities.

The post emphasizes the importance of understanding Kubernetes' mechanisms and encourages using official documentation and community resources to deepen knowledge.

## üîπ Spring Boot - Spring Batch 6.0.0-RC1 is out!
The blog post announces the release of Spring Batch 6.0.0-RC1, now available on Maven Central. This release candidate introduces several new features and improvements, including:

1. **Graceful Shutdown Support**: Allows batch jobs to be stopped in a controlled manner, ensuring consistent state and enabling restartability.
2. **Local Chunking Support**: Enables parallel processing of item chunks within the same JVM using multiple threads, useful for leveraging multi-core processors.
3. **SEDA Style with Spring Integration**: Builds on previous SEDA style processing by using Spring Integration message channels to enable asynchronous processing of batch job stages.
4. **Jackson 3 Support**: Upgrades to Jackson 3.x for JSON processing, offering improved performance and security, while deprecating Jackson 2.x support.
5. **Remote Step Support**: Facilitates executing batch job steps on remote machines or clusters, enhancing performance and scalability for large-scale processing.

The post encourages feedback on GitHub and thanks contributors for their role in the release. For more details, readers are directed to the release notes and other resources linked in the post.

## üîπ Docker - Getting Started with Offload: Automating Everyday Workflows with Docker
The blog post titled "Getting Started with Offload: Automating Everyday Workflows with Docker" discusses the challenges developers face when their local machines struggle with demanding tasks, such as running AI models, compiling large codebases, or handling GPU workloads without the necessary hardware. These issues lead to slow build times and limited performance. The post likely introduces Docker Offload as a solution for automating and optimizing these workflows, enabling developers to overcome the limitations of their local environments. By leveraging Docker, developers can streamline their processes and improve efficiency, even when their personal hardware is insufficient.

## üîπ Java - HTTP/3 Support in JDK 26
The blog post discusses a new feature in JDK 26, where the `HttpClient` API, available since JDK 11, now includes support for HTTP/3. This enhancement allows Java developers to leverage the benefits of HTTP/3, such as improved performance and security features, in their applications. The post likely provides insights into the implementation, benefits, and potential use cases of HTTP/3 within the Java ecosystem.

## üîπ Golang - Flight Recorder in Go 1.25
The blog post discusses the introduction of a new diagnostic tool called "flight recording" in Go version 1.25. This tool is designed to help developers better understand and diagnose issues within their Go applications by recording detailed information about the application's execution. The flight recorder captures various runtime metrics and data, which can be analyzed to identify performance bottlenecks and other issues. This addition aims to enhance the overall debugging and performance tuning process for Go developers.

## üîπ Helm - Helm Turns 10
The blog post titled "Helm Turns 10" celebrates the 10th anniversary of Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes. Helm was created during a hackathon shortly after Kubernetes 1.1.0 was released. The first commit to the Helm project was made by Matt Butcher on October 19, 2015. This initial version, known as Helm Classic, is available on the helm-classic Git repository. Helm later merged with Deployment Manager and became an integral part of the Kubernetes project. The post highlights the journey and development of Helm over the past decade.
