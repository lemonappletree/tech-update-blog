## üîπ Kubernetes - Announcing Changed Block Tracking API support (alpha)
The blog post announces the alpha support for a Changed Block Tracking API in Kubernetes, which enhances the storage ecosystem by allowing CSI storage drivers to efficiently identify changed blocks in PersistentVolume snapshots. This feature enables faster and more resource-efficient backup operations by tracking modifications at the block level, eliminating the need to scan entire volumes during backups. It is currently supported only for block volumes, not file volumes. The implementation involves key components like the CSI SnapshotMetadata Service API, SnapshotMetadataService API, and the External Snapshot Metadata Sidecar. Storage providers and backup solutions need to implement specific requirements to leverage this feature. The post also details the benefits of this API, such as reducing backup windows, resource utilization, and storage costs. It provides guidance on getting started with the feature and discusses its potential future developments. Interested users can find more information through the provided links to official documentation and GitHub repositories. The post acknowledges contributors who helped in the design and implementation and encourages participation in the Kubernetes Storage Special Interest Group.

## üîπ Spring Boot - Securing MCP Servers with Spring AI
The tech blog post discusses securing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers using Spring AI. It highlights the evolving security aspects of MCP and introduces a dedicated project on GitHub, `spring-ai-community/mcp-security`, which is now available for Spring AI 1.1.x-based applications. The post covers three main topics: securing MCP servers with OAuth2, building an MCP-compatible Spring Authorization Server, and using API keys as an alternative to OAuth2.

For OAuth2, the blog explains how to secure MCP servers using OAuth2 access tokens, requiring configuration with a trusted authorization server. It provides detailed instructions on setting up dependencies, configuration, and a sample greeting tool to demonstrate user authentication.

For building an MCP-compatible Spring Authorization Server, it guides readers on creating a server using Spring Authorization Server and configuring clients and users.

The post also addresses environments that lack OAuth2 infrastructure by supporting API keys for authentication. It provides examples of configuring API key security in a Spring application.

Finally, the blog encourages readers to explore the `mcp-security` project for more documentation and samples, inviting contributions and feedback.

## üîπ Docker - Expanding Docker Hardened Images: Secure Helm Charts for Deployments
The blog post discusses the importance of securing software supply chains for development teams and the growing need for trusted images and compliant tooling. Customers are seeking long-term security partners for both development and deployment rather than one-off vendors. In response, Docker is expanding its offerings to include hardened images and secure Helm charts to streamline deployments and enhance security. This initiative aims to provide development teams with the reliable tools and partnerships necessary for maintaining a secure and efficient software supply chain.
