## 🔹 Kubernetes - Kubernetes v1.33: In-Place Pod Resize Graduated to Beta
The Kubernetes project has announced that the in-place Pod resize feature, also known as In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling, which was first introduced as an alpha feature in Kubernetes v1.27, has now graduated to Beta and will be enabled by default in the Kubernetes v1.33 release. This feature allows for changing CPU and memory resources allocated to running containers without requiring a Pod restart, making resource management more flexible and less disruptive, especially for stateful applications and sensitive workloads. Key benefits include reduced disruption, improved resource utilization, and faster scaling. Significant improvements have been made since the alpha release, enhancing stability, user experience, and integration with the Kubernetes ecosystem. The community will continue to develop this feature, focusing on stability, addressing limitations, integrating with VerticalPodAutoscaler (VPA), and gathering user feedback. Users are encouraged to experiment with this feature and provide feedback through standard Kubernetes communication channels.
