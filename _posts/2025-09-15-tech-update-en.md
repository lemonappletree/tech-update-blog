## üîπ Kubernetes - Kubernetes v1.34: Autoconfiguration for Node Cgroup Driver Goes GA
The blog post discusses the general availability (GA) of automatic cgroup driver detection in Kubernetes v1.34. This feature addresses the previous challenge of manually configuring the cgroup driver in Kubernetes clusters, which could lead to misbehavior of the kubelet without clear error messages. The automated detection feature was introduced in v1.28.0 with the `KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI` feature gate, allowing the kubelet to automatically determine the appropriate cgroup driver from the CRI implementation. This feature is now fully supported in Kubernetes v1.34.0.

For this feature to work, cluster administrators must ensure their CRI implementations are updated: containerd requires v2.0.0, and CRI-O requires v1.28.0. Additionally, the blog notes that Kubernetes is deprecating support for containerd v1.y, with v1.35 being the last release to support it. Administrators should upgrade to containerd v2.0 or later before upgrading to kubelet v1.36.0. A new metric, `kubelet_cri_losing_support`, helps detect nodes using soon-to-be-outdated containerd versions.

## üîπ Docker - From Hallucinations to Prompt Injection: Securing AI Workflows at Runtime
The blog post titled "From Hallucinations to Prompt Injection: Securing AI Workflows at Runtime" discusses the importance of embedding runtime security in AI workflows to ensure safe development with AI agents. It highlights how AI tools, while powerful, can be unpredictable and vulnerable to exploitation. The post illustrates this with a scenario where a large language model (LLM) is prompted to generate code, such as a Dockerfile or shell script, which appears correct but may pose security risks when executed. The article emphasizes the need for developers to be vigilant and implement security measures to protect AI workflows from potential threats and attacks.
