## 🔹 Kubernetes - Ingress NGINX Retirement: What You Need to Know
The blog post discusses the upcoming retirement of Ingress NGINX, announced by Kubernetes SIG Network and the Security Response Committee. Maintenance will continue on a best-effort basis until March 2026, after which there will be no further updates or security fixes. Users are encouraged to migrate to alternatives, such as the Gateway API, which serves as the modern replacement for Ingress. Ingress NGINX has faced maintenance challenges due to its complexity and lack of sufficient maintainers. Despite its popularity, the project will be retired, and existing deployments will remain functional but without future updates. Users should begin transitioning to other Ingress controllers or the Gateway API. The retirement emphasizes prioritizing user safety and acknowledges the significant contributions of Ingress NGINX to the Kubernetes ecosystem.
