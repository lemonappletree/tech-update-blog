# 🛠️ 2025-06-24 Tech Update Summary

## 🔹 Kubernetes - Changes to Kubernetes Slack
The Kubernetes Slack workspace was initially set to be downgraded to a standard free version on June 20, 2025, due to Slack's decision to stop providing a free customized enterprise account. However, Salesforce has informed them that the workspace will not be downgraded on that date. The community might move to a new platform later in the year, possibly Discord, which could offer better integration and tools. Channel owners and members are advised to take necessary actions to prepare for the potential platform change and preserve information. Updates and further information will be shared through various communication channels, and feedback can be provided via a GitHub discussion.
