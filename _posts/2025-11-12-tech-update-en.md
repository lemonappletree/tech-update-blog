## 🔹 Spring Boot - LLM Response Evaluation with Spring AI: Building LLM-as-a-Judge Using Recursive Advisors
The tech blog post titled "LLM Response Evaluation with Spring AI: Building LLM-as-a-Judge Using Recursive Advisors" discusses the challenges in evaluating outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), which are crucial for AI applications in production. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BLEU are inadequate for these nuanced outputs, and human evaluation is costly and unscalable. The post introduces "LLM-as-a-Judge," a technique where LLMs evaluate the quality of AI-generated content. Research indicates these models can align with human judgment up to 85%, surpassing human-to-human agreement rates. The article explores how Spring AI's Recursive Advisors offer a framework for implementing this technique, enabling self-improving AI systems with automated quality control. It highlights two main evaluation patterns: Direct Assessment and Pairwise Comparison, and discusses the advantages of using dedicated LLM-as-a-Judge models over general-purpose models. The post provides a detailed implementation example using Spring AI's API, showcasing the SelfRefineEvaluationAdvisor, which iteratively improves AI responses based on evaluation feedback. The blog concludes by emphasizing the benefits of automated quality control, bias mitigation, and integration with Spring AI applications, while noting the experimental nature of Recursive Advisors in Spring AI.

## 🔹 Java - Serialization 2 0: A Marshalling Update!
The tech blog post titled "Serialization 2.0: A Marshalling Update!" discusses the evolution of Java Serialization over the past three decades. The post highlights how Java Serialization, a feature often criticized, has seen changing requirements and constraints for object externalization. The presentation focuses on recent enhancements in the Java language that, along with a clearer division of responsibilities, pave the way for a simpler and safer model for understanding object structures. It offers improved flexibility in state extraction, versioning, encoding, and reconstruction, while supporting a wide range of wire formats.
