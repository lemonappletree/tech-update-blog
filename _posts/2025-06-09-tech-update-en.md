## 🔹 Kubernetes - Introducing Gateway API Inference Extension
The blog post introduces the Gateway API Inference Extension, designed to address unique routing challenges posed by generative AI and large language model (LLM) services on Kubernetes. Traditional load balancers are insufficient for these workloads due to their long-running, resource-intensive, and partially stateful nature. The extension builds on the existing Gateway API to add inference-specific routing capabilities, transforming existing gateways into "Inference Gateways." This allows for model-aware routing, request prioritization, and optimized load balancing based on real-time model metrics, improving AI workload efficiency and reducing latency.

The design introduces two new Custom Resources: InferencePool, which manages resource usage and platform-wide policies, and InferenceModel, which allows AI/ML owners to manage model endpoints and prioritize traffic. The request flow involves smarter, inference-aware routing to optimize resource use and efficiency. Benchmarks show that the extension achieves comparable throughput with lower latency compared to standard Kubernetes services, particularly at higher query rates.

Future roadmap plans include features like prefix-cache aware load balancing, fairness between workloads, and support for various model types and accelerators. The extension aims to simplify and standardize AI/ML traffic routing, making it easier for operations teams to deliver LLM services efficiently.
