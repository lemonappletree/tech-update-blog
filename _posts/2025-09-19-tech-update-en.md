## 🔹 Kubernetes - Kubernetes v1.34: DRA Consumable Capacity
The blog post discusses the introduction of "DRA consumable capacity" in Kubernetes v1.34, enhancing the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) API to support more granular device sharing across Pods and containers. This update addresses limitations in device sharing, enabling fine-grained management and allocation of device resources like network bandwidth. Key features include sharing devices across multiple ResourceClaims or DeviceRequests, new allocation algorithms that prevent over-allocation, and the introduction of "DistinctAttribute" constraints to ensure unique resource allocation. The post guides developers on enabling this feature, provides coding examples, and encourages experimentation and feedback. It highlights the benefits of more efficient resource use, improved scheduling accuracy, and new use cases like bandwidth-aware networking.
