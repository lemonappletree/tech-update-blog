## 🔹 Kubernetes - 7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)
The blog post titled "7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)" discusses the challenges and mistakes often encountered while using Kubernetes, a powerful but sometimes frustrating container orchestration platform. The author shares seven major pitfalls they experienced or observed, along with strategies to avoid them. These include:

1. **Skipping Resource Requests and Limits**: Not setting CPU and memory requirements can lead to resource starvation or hoarding.
2. **Underestimating Liveness and Readiness Probes**: Failing to define health checks can result in unresponsive applications being considered healthy.
3. **Relying Solely on Container Logs**: Depending only on container logs via `kubectl logs` might lead to lost logs after container termination.
4. **Treating Dev and Prod the Same**: Using identical configurations across environments can cause instability and inefficiency.
5. **Leaving Old Resources in the Cluster**: Neglecting to remove unused resources can consume resources and create confusion.
6. **Jumping into Advanced Networking Too Soon**: Implementing complex networking solutions without understanding Kubernetes basics can complicate troubleshooting.
7. **Overlooking Security and RBAC**: Deploying with insecure configurations and broad permissions can expose clusters to risks.

The author emphasizes learning from these mistakes to better understand Kubernetes and suggests utilizing official documentation and community resources for further improvement.
