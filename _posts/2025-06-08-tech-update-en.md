## 🔹 Kubernetes - Introducing Gateway API Inference Extension
The blog post introduces the Gateway API Inference Extension, designed to address traffic-routing challenges for generative AI and large language model (LLM) services on Kubernetes. These services require long-running, resource-intensive sessions, unlike typical web requests, thus creating unique routing challenges. Traditional load balancers are inadequate for these needs as they don't account for model identity or request criticality.

The Gateway API Inference Extension builds on the existing Gateway API to add inference-specific routing capabilities, transforming a regular gateway into an Inference Gateway. It aims to standardize routing for AI/ML workloads, enabling model-aware routing, supporting request criticalities, facilitating safe model roll-outs, and optimizing load balancing based on real-time metrics.

The design introduces two new Custom Resources (CRDs): InferencePool, which manages resource allocation for model servers, and InferenceModel, which allows AI/ML owners to manage model endpoints. The extension provides smarter, model-aware routing and scheduling by examining live pod metrics to optimize requests to the best-performing pods.

Benchmarks indicate that the extension maintains comparable throughput to standard Kubernetes services while reducing latency in high-demand scenarios. The roadmap for the extension includes features like prefix-cache aware load balancing, fairness and priority management, and support for various model types and accelerators.

Overall, the Gateway API Inference Extension aims to simplify AI/ML traffic routing by integrating model-aware features into Kubernetes-native tooling, making it easier for operations teams to efficiently deliver LLM services.
