## 🔹 Kubernetes - Announcing the 2025 Steering Committee Election Results
The blog post announces the results of the 2025 Kubernetes Steering Committee election, where four of the seven seats were up for election. The elected members, serving two-year terms, are Kat Cosgrove, Paco Xu, Rita Zhang, and Maciej Szulik. They join continuing members Antonio Ojea, Benjamin Elder, and Sascha Grunert. The post thanks election officers and emeritus members for their contributions and encourages community involvement in the Steering Committee, which governs the Kubernetes project. The committee holds open meetings monthly, and the community can engage through meeting notes, issues, and pull requests.

## 🔹 Spring Boot - LLM Response Evaluation with Spring AI: Building LLM-as-a-Judge Using Recursive Advisors
The blog post discusses the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators, or "judges," for assessing AI-generated content. Traditional methods like ROUGE and BLEU metrics are inadequate for evaluating the nuanced responses of modern LLMs. Human evaluation, while accurate, is costly and not scalable. The post introduces the concept of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are used to score, classify, or compare AI outputs based on predefined criteria, achieving up to 85% alignment with human judgment. The article explores how Spring AI's Recursive Advisors provide a framework for implementing this evaluation method, allowing for automated quality control and self-improvement in AI systems. It explains two primary evaluation patterns: direct assessment and pairwise comparison, and highlights the benefits of using dedicated LLM-as-a-Judge models over general-purpose models. The post provides a detailed example of implementing a SelfRefineEvaluationAdvisor using Spring AI, which automatically evaluates and retries AI responses based on feedback until a quality threshold is met. Key features include recursive pattern implementation, structured evaluation output, and feedback-driven improvement. The blog concludes with practical advice for integrating LLM-as-a-Judge patterns into AI applications, emphasizing the importance of using dedicated judge models, mitigating bias, and ensuring deterministic results.

## 🔹 Java - Serialization 2 0: A Marshalling Update!
The blog post discusses the evolution of Java Serialization, a feature that has been criticized over the years. It highlights how application requirements for object externalization have changed significantly since Java Serialization's inception nearly three decades ago. The presentation outlines how modern enhancements in the Java language, along with a more straightforward division of responsibilities, can lead to a simpler and safer model for understanding object structures. These changes offer greater flexibility in state extraction, versioning, encoding, and reconstruction, while supporting a wider range of wire formats.
