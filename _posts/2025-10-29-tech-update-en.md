## üîπ Kubernetes - 7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)
The blog post titled "7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)" discusses common mistakes developers make when using Kubernetes and provides tips for avoiding them. The author shares personal experiences and advice on seven main pitfalls:

1. **Skipping Resource Requests and Limits**: Omitting CPU and memory specifications can lead to resource issues. The author suggests starting with modest resource requests and monitoring usage to adjust accordingly.
   
2. **Underestimating Liveness and Readiness Probes**: Properly configuring health checks prevents issues with unresponsive applications. The post advises implementing simple probes to ensure containers are functioning properly.

3. **Relying Solely on Container Logs**: Depending only on `kubectl logs` can result in lost logs after container restarts. The author recommends centralizing logs with tools like Fluentd and pairing them with metrics.

4. **Treating Dev and Prod Environments the Same**: Using identical settings across environments can cause instability. The author suggests customizing configurations for each environment and planning for scale in production.

5. **Leaving Old Resources Around**: Unused resources consume cluster resources. Regular auditing and adopting tools for garbage collection can help manage this issue.

6. **Diving Too Deep into Networking Too Soon**: Implementing advanced networking solutions before understanding basics can complicate troubleshooting. The post recommends starting with simple configurations and expanding as needed.

7. **Going Too Light on Security and RBAC**: Insecure configurations pose security risks. The author advises using RBAC, pinning image versions, and enforcing security contexts.

The post concludes with a reminder that mistakes are learning opportunities and encourages readers to explore Kubernetes documentation and community resources for further learning.

## üîπ Spring Boot - Introducing Spring AI Agents and Spring AI Bench
The blog post introduces two new projects from the Spring AI Community: Spring AI Agents and Spring AI Bench. These projects focus on leveraging agentic coding tools for enterprise Java development and software development life cycle (SDLC) tasks. Spring AI Agents provides a framework with abstractions like AgentClient for using autonomous CLI-based agents, while Spring AI Bench is a benchmark suite for evaluating agents on enterprise workflows. The post highlights the maturity of AI coding agents by 2025 and discusses their utility in improving development speed and consistency. It also critiques existing benchmarks for being outdated and notes the need for modern evaluation tools. The projects are in incubation, with snapshot builds available, and feedback is encouraged as they move towards effective use of agents. The blog includes links to related resources and initiatives.

## üîπ Docker - How to add MCP Servers to Claude Desktop with Docker MCP Toolkit
The blog post explains how to enhance Claude Desktop by integrating it with MCP Servers using the Docker MCP Toolkit. This integration transforms Claude from a simple conversational assistant into a more robust development partner. The Docker MCP Toolkit allows users to safely and securely connect Claude with real developer tools without affecting their local machines. This setup provides a seamless way to extend Claude's capabilities, making it a valuable asset for developers seeking to streamline their workflow.

## üîπ Java - JEP targeted to JDK 26: 504: Remove the Applet API
The tech blog post discusses JEP 504, which is targeted for JDK 26 and involves the removal of the Applet API. The Applet API, once used for creating small applications that could run in web browsers, has become obsolete due to the evolution of web technologies and the deprecation of browser support for Java plugins. The proposal to remove the Applet API is part of ongoing efforts to streamline the Java Development Kit by eliminating outdated and redundant components. This change aims to simplify the JDK and focus on modern application development needs.

## üîπ Golang - Flight Recorder in Go 1.25
The blog post discusses the introduction of a new diagnostic tool called "flight recording" in Go 1.25. This tool aims to enhance the ability to capture and analyze program execution for debugging and performance optimization. By enabling flight recording, developers can collect detailed runtime data, which can be invaluable for diagnosing issues and understanding program behavior. The post likely provides insights on how to implement and use flight recording effectively within Go applications.

## üîπ Helm - Helm Turns 10
The blog post celebrates the 10th anniversary of Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes. Helm originated at a hackathon following the release of Kubernetes 1.1.0. The first commit, made by author Matt Butcher on October 19, 2015, can be found in the helm-classic Git repository. Initially, Helm was a standalone project before merging with Deployment Manager and becoming part of the Kubernetes ecosystem.
