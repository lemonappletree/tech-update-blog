## 🔹 Kubernetes - Kubernetes 1.33: Job's SuccessPolicy Goes GA
The tech blog post announces that Kubernetes has released version 1.33, which includes the general availability (GA) of the "Job success policy" feature. This feature is particularly useful for batch workloads using leader-follower patterns, such as scientific simulations, AI/ML, and HPC applications. The success policy allows users to mark a Kubernetes Job as successful even if not all Pods complete successfully, which is useful when only a subset of tasks needs to complete for overall success. The feature is implemented through the `.spec.successPolicy` field in the API, which sets rules based on succeeded indexes or a minimum number of successes. Examples are provided to illustrate how to configure these policies. The post encourages interested parties to read the documentation, engage with the Kubernetes community, and participate in discussions and meetings through Slack and other channels.
