## 🔹 Kubernetes - 7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)
The blog post titled "7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)" discusses common mistakes users make when using Kubernetes and offers advice on how to avoid them. The author shares personal experiences and insights to help users manage Kubernetes more effectively. The seven pitfalls highlighted are:

1. **Skipping Resource Requests and Limits**: Failing to specify CPU and memory requirements can lead to resource contention or wastage. It's crucial to set and adjust these values based on real-world usage.

2. **Underestimating Liveness and Readiness Probes**: Not setting up proper health checks can lead to issues with unresponsive applications. Using simple probes can help ensure containers are only restarted or receive traffic when ready.

3. **Relying Solely on Container Logs**: Depending only on `kubectl logs` can lead to lost logs upon container deletion. Centralizing logs with tools like Fluentd or Fluent Bit is recommended.

4. **Treating Dev and Prod the Same**: Using identical settings across environments can cause issues due to differing needs. Customizing configurations for each environment is advised.

5. **Leaving Old Resources Running**: Not cleaning up unused resources can consume cluster resources and increase costs. Regular audits and using tools like Kyverno can help manage this.

6. **Diving Too Deep into Networking Too Soon**: Implementing advanced networking without understanding basics can complicate troubleshooting. It's better to start simple and add complexity as needed.

7. **Going Too Light on Security and RBAC**: Insecure configurations can leave clusters vulnerable. Using RBAC and pinning image versions can enhance security.

The author emphasizes learning from mistakes and provides links to official Kubernetes documentation for further guidance.

## 🔹 Golang - Flight Recorder in Go 1.25
The blog post discusses the introduction of a new diagnostic tool called "flight recording" in Go 1.25. This tool is designed to help developers better understand and debug their Go applications by capturing detailed runtime information. Flight recording allows developers to record and analyze the behavior of their programs, making it easier to identify performance bottlenecks and other issues. This new feature enhances the overall observability of Go applications and provides valuable insights for improving code efficiency and reliability.

## 🔹 Helm - Helm Turns 10
The blog post commemorates the 10th anniversary of Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes, which was created during a hackathon shortly after the release of Kubernetes 1.1.0. The initial commit for Helm was made by Matt Butcher on October 19, 2015, and can be found in the helm-classic Git repository. The original Helm was developed before it integrated with Deployment Manager and became part of the Kubernetes project. The post is available on the Helm blog.
