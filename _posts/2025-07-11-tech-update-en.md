## 🔹 Kubernetes - Navigating Failures in Pods With Devices
The blog post discusses the complexities of managing failures in Kubernetes pods that use specialized hardware, such as GPUs, which are crucial for AI/ML workloads. These workloads present unique challenges due to their reliance on specific hardware and the high cost of idle time. Kubernetes, while a leading platform for container orchestration, struggles with handling hardware failures efficiently. The article explores various failure modes, including infrastructure issues, device failures, container code failures, and device degradation. It highlights existing DIY solutions and best practices to mitigate these issues, such as health controllers and custom pod watchers. The post also outlines the roadmap for improving failure management, focusing on enhancing Kubernetes' extension points to better support AI/ML workloads. Despite these challenges, Kubernetes remains a preferred platform due to its maturity, security, and ecosystem. The article concludes by inviting community participation in ongoing discussions to improve device failure handling in Kubernetes.
