## üîπ Kubernetes - Introducing Headlamp Plugin for Karpenter - Scaling and Visibility
The blog post introduces the Headlamp Karpenter Plugin, a tool that enhances the Headlamp UI to provide real-time visibility into Karpenter's autoscaling activities in Kubernetes clusters. Karpenter is a project that efficiently manages node provisioning, and the plugin allows users to see how Karpenter resources relate to Kubernetes objects. It provides visualizations of live metrics, scaling events, and enables users to inspect pending pods, review scaling decisions, and edit Karpenter-managed resources with validation support. The plugin aims to help Kubernetes users better understand and fine-tune autoscaling behaviors. It includes features such as a map view of resources, visualization of metrics, scaling decision insights, a config editor, and real-time tracking of Karpenter resources. The plugin has been tested with certain providers like AWS and Azure, while others remain untested. Users are encouraged to provide feedback and report issues or contribute to the project.

## üîπ Spring Boot - Introducing Jackson 3 support in Spring
The blog post discusses the introduction of Jackson 3 support in Spring, following the release of Jackson 3.0.0. This update will be included in Spring Boot 4 and related projects. Jackson is a widely-used JSON library on the JVM, and the new version offers enhancements over the previous integration improvements announced over a decade ago. The Spring team collaborated closely with the Jackson team, resulting in refinements that will benefit the community, such as allowing Jackson 2 and 3 to be used side by side and aligning defaults.

With Spring Boot 4, Jackson 3 becomes the default, while Jackson 2 support is deprecated. The Spring portfolio will manage dependencies for both versions but will auto-configure only for Jackson 3, encouraging applications to migrate. The blog post provides guidance on migrating to Jackson 3, highlighting changes like package updates and default settings adaptations.

Significant changes include the introduction of an immutable JsonMapper, replacing the mutable ObjectMapper, and the deprecation of MappingJacksonValue in favor of serialization hints. Applications can temporarily continue using Jackson 2, with added support for both versions.

The post also covers Jackson 3 support in Spring Security and Spring Data, noting that some modules require migration to Jackson 3. The blog acknowledges the breaking changes introduced with Jackson 3 but emphasizes the security and API improvements. The Spring team offers guidance and support to facilitate the migration process and seeks feedback to refine their guidance and documentation.
