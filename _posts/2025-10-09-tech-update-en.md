## 🔹 Spring Boot - Introducing Jackson 3 support in Spring
The blog post discusses the introduction of Jackson 3 support in Spring, which follows the recent release of Jackson 3.0.0. Jackson is a widely-used JSON library in the JVM ecosystem, and this update brings numerous enhancements to Spring Boot 4 and related Spring projects. The collaboration between the Spring and Jackson teams has resulted in several improvements, such as allowing Jackson 2 and 3 to coexist, aligning JSON view defaults, and enhancing non-blocking parsers.

With Spring Boot 4, Jackson 3 will be the default JSON library, while support for Jackson 2 will be deprecated. Applications are encouraged to migrate to Jackson 3, but can still use Jackson 2 temporarily. Key migration steps include updating package names, adapting to new default settings, and using the new immutable JsonMapper instead of the mutable ObjectMapper. The blog also outlines the changes in Spring's support for Jackson modules and highlights that certain Spring Data projects will require migration to Jackson 3.

Spring Security and Spring Data also plan to integrate Jackson 3 support, with Spring Security enhancing security by disabling default global typing. The blog emphasizes that Jackson 3 offers improved security and capabilities, although migrating may involve some effort. The Spring team is committed to providing guidance and support throughout this transition.
