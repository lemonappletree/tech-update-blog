## 🔹 Kubernetes - Kubernetes v1.33: New features in DRA
The blog post discusses the updates and new features in Kubernetes v1.33 related to Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA). Initially introduced as an alpha feature in v1.26, DRA has undergone significant changes and improvements, moving to beta in v1.32 with a goal for general availability in v1.34. In v1.33, DRA remains in beta, but several features have been enhanced. The "Driver-owned Resource Claim Status" feature has been promoted to beta, allowing drivers to report specific device status data, useful for network devices. New alpha features include "Partitionable Devices" for dynamic device partitioning, "Device Taints and Tolerations" for marking devices as unavailable, "Prioritized List" for specifying acceptable devices, and updated "Admin Access" controls. The post also highlights preparations for general availability with a new v1beta2 API and improved RBAC rules. The Kubernetes device management working group aims to make DRA generally available by v1.34 and encourages community involvement. Acknowledgments are given to contributors who have supported these developments.
