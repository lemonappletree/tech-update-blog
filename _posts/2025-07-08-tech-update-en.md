## 🔹 Kubernetes - Navigating Failures in Pods With Devices
The blog post discusses the complexities of handling specialized hardware like GPUs in Kubernetes, particularly in managing failure modes of pods with devices. With the rise of AI/ML workloads, which heavily depend on such hardware, Kubernetes faces challenges due to its static view of resources, where device failures can significantly impact performance. The article explores different failure modes, including infrastructure, device, container code, and device degradation failures, and presents DIY solutions like health controllers and custom pod watchers. Despite these challenges, Kubernetes remains the preferred platform for AI/ML workloads due to its maturity and ecosystem. The blog outlines a roadmap for improving device failure handling, emphasizing extension points for customized solutions and cheaper error handling. It encourages community participation in shaping the future of device failure management in Kubernetes.

## 🔹 Spring Boot - Spring gRPC 0.9.0 available now
The blog post announces the release of Spring gRPC version 0.9.0, which is now available on Maven Central. The team aims for a 1.0.0 release to coincide with Spring Boot 4.0.0. Key updates in this version include an upgrade to Spring Boot 3.5, changes to the `StubFactory` contract with the "supports" method now being static, removal of `GrpcClientFactoryCustomizer` in favor of `GrpcChannelBuilderCustomizer`, and new capabilities for filtering interceptors and service definitions in both in-process and Netty gRPC servers. The post invites contributions and questions from the community, directing them to GitHub for issues and Stack Overflow for general queries using the `spring-grpc` tag. Links to relevant resources such as GitHub, issues, documentation, and Stack Overflow are provided.

## 🔹 Docker - From Dev to Deploy: Compose as the Spine of the Application Lifecycle
The blog post discusses the importance of having a robust application development process, using the analogy of a spine as a backbone that supports and guides. It highlights how Docker Compose serves as this backbone throughout the application lifecycle, from development to deployment. The post emphasizes that without a structured process, akin to a spineless body, applications can become weak and difficult to manage. Docker Compose is portrayed as an essential tool that ensures stability and clarity in understanding and managing the application's various components and stages.
