## üîπ Kubernetes - Navigating Failures in Pods With Devices
The blog post discusses the challenges and solutions in managing failures of pods with specialized hardware, such as GPUs, in Kubernetes. As AI/ML workloads increasingly rely on such hardware, any device failure can significantly disrupt operations. The traditional assumptions of Kubernetes resource management don't align well with the specific needs of AI/ML tasks, which often require specific devices and interconnected pods. Despite these challenges, Kubernetes remains a preferred platform due to its maturity and ecosystem.

The blog outlines various failure modes, including infrastructure, device, container code, and device degradation failures, and explores DIY solutions and best practices currently in use. It emphasizes that while Kubernetes provides extension points, handling device failures often requires custom solutions due to the platform's limited built-in mechanisms.

Looking ahead, Kubernetes aims to enhance its handling of these failures by improving extension points and incorporating new features, such as integrating device failures into pod failure policies and enabling more efficient resource reuse. The post encourages community participation in developing these solutions and highlights that addressing these issues will strengthen Kubernetes' role in AI/ML workloads.
