## 🔹 Kubernetes - 7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)
The blog post titled "7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)" discusses common mistakes encountered when working with Kubernetes, a container orchestration platform. The author shares personal experiences and provides insights on how to avoid these pitfalls, which include:

1. **Skipping Resource Requests and Limits**: Not specifying CPU and memory demands can lead to resource starvation or hoarding. It's recommended to start with modest requests and adjust based on real-world usage.

2. **Underestimating Liveness and Readiness Probes**: Properly configuring these probes is crucial for ensuring that containers are healthy and ready to serve traffic.

3. **Relying Solely on Container Logs**: Depending only on `kubectl logs` can be problematic. Instead, centralize logs using tools like Fluentd or Fluent Bit.

4. **Treating Dev and Prod the Same**: Different environments require customized configurations. Use tools like Kustomize to manage environment-specific settings.

5. **Leaving Old Resources Active**: Unused resources can waste resources and create confusion. Regular audits and labeling can help manage this.

6. **Diving Too Deep into Networking Too Soon**: It's important to understand Kubernetes' native networking before implementing advanced solutions like service meshes.

7. **Neglecting Security and RBAC**: Secure configurations and role-based access control (RBAC) are essential to prevent security breaches.

The author encourages readers to learn from mistakes, utilize official documentation, and engage with the Kubernetes community.
