## üîπ Kubernetes - Post-Quantum Cryptography in Kubernetes
The blog post discusses the integration of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) in the Kubernetes ecosystem, emphasizing the importance of transitioning to PQC due to the potential threat posed by quantum computing to classical cryptographic systems like RSA and ECC. It introduces the concept of PQC, focusing on hybrid key exchange mechanisms in TLS that combine classical algorithms with PQC algorithms, such as the Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM). The post highlights the unexpected adoption of PQC in Kubernetes v1.33 due to its underlying use of Go 1.24, which supports hybrid PQC KEM by default. It also addresses potential issues like version mismatches between different Go versions, the larger packet sizes of PQC keys, and the current state of PQC digital signatures, which face challenges in terms of key size, performance, and toolchain support. The article concludes by noting the progress toward a quantum-safe Kubernetes environment, while acknowledging the need for further development and awareness of potential pitfalls.

## üîπ Docker - Docker Unveils the Future of Agentic Apps at WeAreDevelopers
In the blog post titled "Docker Unveils the Future of Agentic Apps at WeAreDevelopers," Docker explores the concept of agentic applications. These are defined as applications that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to establish execution workflows based on specific goals, integrating with tools, data, and systems. The post discusses the challenges and innovations in building, testing, and deploying these applications, highlighting new elements introduced to the application stack to support this emerging technology.

## üîπ Java - JEP targeted to JDK 25: 518: JFR Cooperative Sampling
The blog post discusses JEP 518, which is aimed at being included in JDK 25. The focus of this JEP is on JFR (Java Flight Recorder) Cooperative Sampling. This enhancement is designed to improve the efficiency and performance of data recording in Java applications by introducing a cooperative sampling mechanism. Cooperative sampling allows the system to better manage and reduce the overhead associated with data collection, leading to more efficient monitoring and analysis of Java applications. The post highlights the significance of this improvement for developers and the Java community as it aims to optimize performance without sacrificing the quality of data collected for profiling and diagnostics.

## üîπ Golang - The FIPS 140-3 Go Cryptographic Module
The blog post discusses the introduction of a built-in, native FIPS 140-3 compliant mode in the Go programming language. This addition ensures that Go's cryptographic library meets the stringent security requirements set by the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). This compliance is crucial for developers working in regulated industries where adherence to such standards is mandatory. The post likely details the implementation process, benefits, and potential use cases for this new feature in Go, highlighting its significance for enhancing security in software development.
