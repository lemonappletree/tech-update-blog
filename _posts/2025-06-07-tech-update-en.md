## 🔹 Kubernetes - Introducing Gateway API Inference Extension
The blog post introduces the Gateway API Inference Extension, a new tool designed to address the unique challenges of routing traffic for generative AI and large language model (LLM) services on Kubernetes. Traditional load balancers are not well-suited for LLM inference sessions, which are long-running and resource-intensive. The Gateway API Inference Extension builds on the existing Gateway API to add inference-specific routing capabilities, allowing for model-aware routing, request prioritization, and optimized load balancing based on real-time metrics. It introduces two new Custom Resources: InferencePool, which manages how model servers are deployed and balanced, and InferenceModel, which allows AI/ML owners to manage model endpoints and traffic policies. The extension aims to improve latency and GPU utilization by providing smarter routing mechanisms. Benchmarks show that the extension reduces latency for GPU-backed LLM workloads. Future plans include features like prefix-cache aware load balancing, support for multi-modal inputs/outputs, and heterogeneous accelerators. The project aims to standardize AI/ML traffic routing with Kubernetes-native tooling, making it easier for operations teams to deliver AI services efficiently.
