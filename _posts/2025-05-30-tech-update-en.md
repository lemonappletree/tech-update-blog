## 🔹 Kubernetes - Kubernetes v1.33: In-Place Pod Resize Graduated to Beta
The blog post announces that the in-place Pod resize feature, also known as In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling, has graduated from alpha to beta and will be enabled by default in Kubernetes v1.33. This feature allows users to adjust CPU and memory resources for running Pods without needing to restart them, which is particularly beneficial for stateful applications, batch jobs, and workloads sensitive to restarts. This advancement in resource management offers reduced disruption, improved resource utilization, and faster scaling capabilities. The post outlines the changes and improvements made from alpha to beta, including the introduction of a `resize` subresource for modifying Pod resources, improved checkpointing and state tracking, and enhanced CRI integration. The community is focused on further stabilizing the feature, integrating it with the VerticalPodAutoscaler, and gathering user feedback. Users are encouraged to try out the feature and provide feedback through the standard Kubernetes communication channels.
