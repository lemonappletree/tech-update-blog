## 🔹 Kubernetes - Ingress NGINX Retirement: What You Need to Know
The blog post announces the upcoming retirement of Ingress NGINX, a popular Ingress controller for Kubernetes, by March 2026. Until then, it will receive best-effort maintenance, but after that date, there will be no further updates, bug fixes, or security vulnerability resolutions. Existing deployments and installation artifacts will remain functional and accessible. Users are advised to migrate to alternatives, particularly the Gateway API, a modern replacement for Ingress. The decision to retire Ingress NGINX stems from maintenance challenges and evolving security expectations. Despite its popularity, the project has struggled with limited maintenance resources. The Kubernetes community is urged to transition to alternative solutions to ensure continued security and functionality.
