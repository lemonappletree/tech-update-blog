## 🔹 Kubernetes - Ingress NGINX Retirement: What You Need to Know
The Kubernetes SIG Network and Security Response Committee have announced the retirement of Ingress NGINX, with best-effort maintenance continuing until March 2026. After this date, no further releases, bug fixes, or security updates will be provided, although existing deployments will continue to function, and installation artifacts will remain accessible. Users are encouraged to migrate to alternatives, such as the Gateway API, which is a modern replacement for Ingress. While Ingress NGINX has been popular for its flexibility and features, maintaining it has been challenging due to limited resources and evolving security standards. The project will be retired to prioritize user safety, and Ingress NGINX users are urged to start transitioning to other solutions immediately.
