# 🛠️ 2025-06-23 Tech Update Summary

## 🔹 Kubernetes - Changes to Kubernetes Slack
The Kubernetes Slack workspace was initially set to be downgraded to a standard free account on June 20, 2025, due to Slack's decision to stop supporting the project with a free customized enterprise account. However, Salesforce has notified that the workspace will not be downgraded on the planned date. As a result, there is currently no urgency to back up private channels or direct messages. Despite this, the community is considering moving to a new platform, such as Discord, due to limitations with Slack and to explore new tools and integrations. The Kubernetes community is encouraged to prepare for potential changes, and further updates will be provided through their FAQ, mailing list, and announcements channel.
