## 🔹 Kubernetes - 7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)
The blog post titled "7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)" outlines challenges encountered when using Kubernetes and offers strategies to prevent them. The author describes their initial struggles with Kubernetes and provides insights into seven common pitfalls. These include:

1. **Skipping Resource Requests and Limits**: Not defining CPU and memory requirements can lead to resource starvation or hoarding. It's important to set and monitor these values to ensure efficient cluster management.

2. **Underestimating Liveness and Readiness Probes**: Without these probes, Kubernetes might not correctly assess container health, causing issues like unresponsive applications. Simple probes can help manage container health effectively.

3. **Relying Solely on Container Logs**: Using only `kubectl logs` can lead to lost data since logs aren't preserved after container deletion. Centralizing logs and adopting tools like Fluentd or Fluent Bit is recommended.

4. **Treating Dev and Prod the Same**: Using identical configurations across environments can cause performance or security issues. Customizing settings for different environments is crucial.

5. **Leaving Old Resources**: Unused resources can consume cluster space and increase costs. Regular audits and labeling resources help manage this.

6. **Diving Too Deep into Networking Too Soon**: Implementing complex networking solutions without understanding basic Kubernetes networking can complicate troubleshooting. Start with simple setups and gradually introduce advanced features.

7. **Going Too Light on Security and RBAC**: Insecure configurations can lead to vulnerabilities. Use RBAC, pin image versions, and enforce security contexts to mitigate risks.

The post emphasizes learning from mistakes and understanding Kubernetes to avoid unnecessary challenges. It encourages using official documentation and community resources for further learning.

## 🔹 Java - Three Upcoming G1 Improvements - Inside Java Newscast #99
The blog post discusses upcoming improvements to Java's G1 garbage collector. These include the recently merged JEP 522, which adds a second card table to boost throughput, and the candidate JEP 523, which proposes making G1 the default garbage collector even in scenarios where Serial GC was traditionally used. Additionally, there are draft proposals for implementing automatic heap sizing for both G1 and ZGC.

## 🔹 Helm - Helm Turns 10
The blog post celebrates the 10th anniversary of Helm, which originated from a hackathon shortly after the release of Kubernetes 1.1.0. The first commit to the Helm project was made by Matt Butcher on October 19, 2015. This initial version, known as Helm v1, is documented in the helm-classic Git repository. Helm later merged with Deployment Manager and became part of the Kubernetes project.
