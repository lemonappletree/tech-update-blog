## 🔹 Kubernetes - Kubernetes v1.34: Pod Replacement Policy for Jobs Goes GA
The blog post announces that the Pod replacement policy feature in Kubernetes v1.34 has reached general availability (GA). This feature allows users to control when the Kubernetes control plane replaces terminating Pods in Jobs, addressing issues in certain workloads, such as machine learning frameworks, which require exactly one Pod per worker index. The default behavior of the Job controller is to immediately recreate Pods when they fail or start terminating, which can lead to problems like duplicate task errors, scheduling delays, unnecessary cluster scaling, and quota bypassing. With the new Pod replacement policy, users can choose between two options: `TerminatingOrFailed` (default), which replaces Pods as soon as they start terminating, and `Failed`, which waits until Pods fully terminate and reach the `Failed` phase before replacement. The post provides an example of how to configure this policy and discusses the implications for Job execution. Additionally, it acknowledges contributors to the feature and encourages interested parties to get involved with the Kubernetes community.
