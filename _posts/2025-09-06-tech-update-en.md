## 🔹 Kubernetes - Kubernetes v1.34: Pod Replacement Policy for Jobs Goes GA
The blog post announces that the "Pod replacement policy" feature in Kubernetes has reached general availability in version 1.34. This feature provides users with control over the replacement of terminating Pods in Jobs, addressing issues that arise when multiple Pods run simultaneously, which can be problematic for applications like TensorFlow and JAX. The Pod replacement policy introduces two options: "TerminatingOrFailed" (default), which replaces Pods as soon as they start terminating, and "Failed," which waits until Pods fully terminate. This control helps prevent scheduling delays, unnecessary cluster scale-ups, and quota bypassing. The post includes examples, explains the functionality, and acknowledges contributors. It encourages community involvement and provides links for further reading.
