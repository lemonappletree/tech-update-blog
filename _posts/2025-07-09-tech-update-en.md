## 🔹 Kubernetes - Navigating Failures in Pods With Devices
The blog post discusses the challenges of managing failures in Kubernetes pods that use specialized hardware like GPUs, especially in the context of AI/ML workloads. As AI/ML tasks often require specific hardware and can be sensitive to device failures, Kubernetes faces unique issues in handling these scenarios. The post outlines various failure modes, including infrastructure, device, container code, and device degradation failures, and explores existing best practices and DIY solutions to manage them. Kubernetes, while being the platform of choice for AI/ML workloads due to its maturity and ecosystem, currently has limitations in dealing with these specialized failures. The post also highlights ongoing and future efforts in Kubernetes to improve handling of such failures, focusing on enhancing extension points and making failure information more accessible. The Kubernetes community is invited to contribute to these discussions and developments to maintain Kubernetes as a resilient platform for AI/ML applications.

## 🔹 Docker - Introducing Docker Hub MCP Server: A New Way to Discover, Inspect, and Manage Container Images
The blog post introduces the Docker Hub MCP Server, a new tool designed to enhance how developers discover, inspect, and manage container images. Docker Hub is already a crucial platform for developers globally, facilitating 11 billion image downloads each month and hosting over 14 million container images. With the rise of agentic AI, there is a noticeable transformation in developers' workflows. They are increasingly using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to support their AI agents and automate workflows. The Docker Hub MCP Server aims to assist developers in adapting to these changes by providing improved capabilities for managing container images.
