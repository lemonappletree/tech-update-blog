## 🔹 Kubernetes - Kubernetes v1.35 Sneak Peek
The tech blog post provides a preview of the upcoming Kubernetes v1.35 release, highlighting significant changes and enhancements. Key deprecations include the removal of cgroup v1 support, deprecation of ipvs mode in kube-proxy, and the end of support for containerd v1.x. The release introduces several enhancements: "node declared features" for better scheduling precision, in-place updates of Pod resources for more efficient scaling, native Pod certificates for improved security, numeric values for taints to enhance scheduling, user namespaces for increased security, and support for mounting OCI images as volumes. These updates aim to improve Kubernetes' stability, security, and resource management. The post also encourages community involvement and provides links for further engagement and updates. The release is planned for December 17, 2025.

## 🔹 Spring Boot - Towards Spring Tools 5 - Stereotypes and a new Structural View
The blog post discusses the enhancements in the upcoming Spring Tools 5, focusing on the integration of stereotypes and a new logical structure view for Spring projects. Previously, Spring-specific symbols were used to navigate and overview projects. The new release, in collaboration with Spring Modulith and jMolecules, introduces a logical structure view that visually organizes project elements by their stereotypes rather than file structure. This provides a more intuitive understanding of the project's components, like web controllers and repositories. Users can customize which stereotypes to display, offering flexibility in project visualization. Furthermore, the tool supports the modular structure when using Spring Modulith. Developers can also define custom stereotypes using a specific JSON file or jMolecules annotations, which the Spring Tools will recognize and integrate into the logical structure view. The post concludes by inviting users to try the latest release candidates and announces future updates on AI coding assistant integration.

## 🔹 Docker - Run Embedding Models and Unlock Semantic Search with Docker Model Runner
The blog post discusses the importance of embedding models in modern AI applications such as semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and intelligent recommendation systems. These models help systems comprehend the meaning behind text, code, or documents beyond their literal words. However, generating embeddings often involves trade-offs, especially when using hosted APIs. The post likely explores how Docker Model Runner can be utilized to run embedding models effectively, potentially addressing some of the challenges associated with hosted APIs.

## 🔹 Java - Agent Orchestration with LangChain4J
The blog post discusses LangChain4J, a library designed to help developers integrate language models and AI workflows into Java applications. It highlights the growing popularity of Langchain4j within the Java and enterprise AI communities. The focus is on the langchain4j-agentic module, which allows for the combination of AI and non-AI agents into controlled workflows. The post explores core patterns including sequential, looping, conditional, parallel, and the supervisor pattern where agents autonomously decide which tasks to execute. It also addresses human validation strategies for monitoring agent actions. Compound agents can encapsulate entire workflows, while AgenticScope offers context control and insight into the call chain. The presentation includes demos that demonstrate scalable agent systems suitable for tasks ranging from minor to complex automation. The content targets both those curious about AI and developers ready to implement these concepts, offering insights into current capabilities and how Java developers are contributing to the evolution of agent technology.
