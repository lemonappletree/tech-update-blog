## üîπ Kubernetes - 7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)
The blog post titled "7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)" discusses common mistakes encountered when using Kubernetes and provides tips on how to avoid them. The author shares personal experiences and insights to help others navigate these challenges effectively. The key pitfalls include:

1. **Skipping Resource Requests and Limits:** Neglecting to specify CPU and memory requirements can lead to resource starvation or hoarding, affecting performance and stability. To avoid this, start with modest resource requests, monitor usage, and adjust as needed.

2. **Underestimating Liveness and Readiness Probes:** Not defining health checks for containers can result in unresponsive applications. Implement simple liveness and readiness probes to ensure containers are functioning correctly.

3. **Relying Solely on Container Logs:** Using only `kubectl logs` is insufficient as logs can be lost upon container deletion. Centralize logs with tools like Fluentd or Fluent Bit for better monitoring and analysis.

4. **Treating Dev and Prod Environments the Same:** Using identical settings across environments can lead to issues due to differing resource needs. Customize configurations using tools like kustomize and plan for scaling in production.

5. **Leaving Old Resources in the Cluster:** Outdated resources consume resources and increase costs. Label resources, audit regularly, and use policy automation to manage lifecycle and cleanup.

6. **Diving Too Deep into Networking Too Soon:** Introducing advanced networking solutions early can complicate troubleshooting. Start with basic networking, understand core concepts, and scale up as needed.

7. **Going Too Light on Security and RBAC:** Insecure configurations pose risks. Use RBAC for permissions, pin images to specific versions, and enforce security policies like Pod Security Admission.

The author emphasizes learning from mistakes and leveraging community resources like official Kubernetes documentation and community Slack for further exploration.
