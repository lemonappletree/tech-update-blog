## 🔹 Kubernetes - Ingress NGINX Retirement: What You Need to Know
The blog post announces the upcoming retirement of Ingress NGINX, as decided by Kubernetes SIG Network and the Security Response Committee, to ensure ecosystem safety and security. Maintenance will continue on a best-effort basis until March 2026, after which there will be no more updates or security fixes. Existing deployments will still function, and installation artifacts will remain accessible. Users are urged to migrate to alternatives such as the Gateway API, the modern replacement for Ingress, or other Ingress controllers listed in Kubernetes documentation. The post discusses the history of Ingress NGINX, its initial popularity due to flexibility, and the challenges faced with maintenance. Despite past efforts to find support for Ingress NGINX, it will be retired due to insufficient maintainership. Users are strongly advised to start migration to other solutions immediately.
