## 🔹 Kubernetes - Navigating Failures in Pods With Devices
The blog post addresses the complexities of managing device-related failures in Kubernetes, particularly with the rise of AI/ML workloads that heavily depend on specialized hardware like GPUs. It highlights the limitations of Kubernetes in dealing with hardware failures and the static nature of its resource management. The post discusses various failure modes, including infrastructure, device failures, container code failures, and device degradation, and the challenges they pose. It also outlines the DIY solutions currently in use and the best practices for handling these failures, such as health controllers, pod failure policies, and custom pod watchers. The post emphasizes Kubernetes' continued dominance in the AI/ML space due to its maturity and ecosystem, while acknowledging the need for improvements in handling device failures. The roadmap section details planned enhancements to Kubernetes' failure management capabilities, including better integration with device health status and more efficient error handling and recovery processes. The blog encourages community participation in developing solutions to these challenges, aiming to strengthen Kubernetes' position as a robust platform for AI/ML workloads.
