## 🔹 Docker - A New Approach for Coding Agent Safety
The blog post discusses the rise of coding agents such as Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, Kiro, and OpenCode, which are transforming the way developers work by becoming more autonomous. These agents have capabilities like deleting repositories, modifying files, and accessing secrets, which poses a challenge for developers. The main issue is finding a balance between granting these agents enough access to be effective while minimizing potential risks to local systems. The blog suggests a new approach using "Docker Sandboxes" to enhance the safety of these coding agents.
