## üîπ Kubernetes - Post-Quantum Cryptography in Kubernetes
The blog post discusses the significance of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) in the context of Kubernetes, particularly in light of the potential threats posed by quantum computing to current cryptographic standards. PQC aims to develop cryptographic algorithms that are secure against both classical and quantum computers. The article emphasizes the urgency of transitioning to PQC algorithms, highlighting key exchange as an immediate priority due to the risk of future decryption by quantum computers.

The post examines the current state of PQC in Kubernetes, noting that as of version 1.33, Kubernetes supports hybrid post-quantum key exchange by default due to its use of Go 1.24. This version of Go includes support for the X25519MLKEM768 hybrid scheme, marking a significant step towards making Kubernetes quantum-safe.

However, challenges remain, such as potential issues with mismatched Go versions leading to fallback to classical cryptography, and the larger packet sizes required by PQC, which can cause network issues. The post also discusses the slower adoption of PQC digital signatures, which face hurdles like larger key sizes and performance issues.

Overall, the blog post underscores the importance of staying informed about PQC developments to ensure the long-term security of Kubernetes, while acknowledging the proactive steps already taken in integrating PQC key exchange mechanisms.

## üîπ Docker - GoFiber v3 + Testcontainers: Production-like Local Dev with Air
The blog post discusses the challenges of local development when applications depend on external services, such as databases or message queues, which can result in fragile scripts and inconsistent environments. The new version of Fiber, v3, combined with Testcontainers, addresses these issues by integrating real service dependencies into the application's lifecycle. This integration makes the development process more manageable, reproducible, and user-friendly for developers. The post highlights the upcoming release of Fiber v3, which introduces significant improvements to enhance local development experiences by leveraging these tools.

## üîπ Java - Java Gets a JSON API - Inside Java Newscast #95
The blog post discusses the introduction of a JSON API for Java, highlighting its necessity given JSON's widespread use as a data exchange format. Java, known for being a comprehensive language with built-in tools, aims to include a native JSON API to align with its "batteries included" philosophy. The episode covers an OpenJDK email that initiates the exploration of developing this API, emphasizing the importance of integrating JSON capabilities directly into the Java ecosystem.
