## üîπ Kubernetes - Kubernetes v1.33: Fine-grained SupplementalGroups Control Graduates to Beta
The blog post discusses the advancement of the `supplementalGroupsPolicy` feature in Kubernetes, which has moved from alpha in version 1.31 to beta in version 1.33. This feature allows for more precise control over supplemental groups in containers, enhancing security, especially for volume access, and improving UID/GID transparency. The post highlights a significant change in behavior with this beta release, urging users to review upgrade considerations and potential impacts on existing setups. The feature addresses issues with implicit group memberships defined in `/etc/group` within container images, which can pose security risks due to unrecorded group IDs. Kubernetes now offers two policies: `Merge` (default, backward-compatible) and `Strict` (excludes implicit GIDs from `/etc/group`). The `Strict` policy requires updated CRI runtimes like containerd v2.0 or later and CRI-O v1.31 or later. The blog advises on handling upgrades to avoid pod rejections and encourages community involvement through SIG Node. For more information, it provides links to relevant Kubernetes documentation and enhancement proposals.

## üîπ Docker - Securing Model Context Protocol: Safer Agentic AI with Containers
The blog post discusses the growing adoption of Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools and the increasing security concerns that accompany this trend. As MCP tools enhance agent autonomy, they introduce risks related to potential misalignment between the agent's behavior and user expectations, as well as the threat of uncontrolled execution. The article highlights the need to address these security issues to ensure safer use of agentic AI, emphasizing the importance of implementing security measures as MCP tools become more widespread.
