## üîπ Kubernetes - Introducing Gateway API Inference Extension
The blog post introduces the Gateway API Inference Extension, which addresses traffic-routing challenges for modern generative AI and large language model (LLM) services on Kubernetes. Traditional load balancers are inadequate for these workloads, as they are often long-running, resource-intensive, and partially stateful. The Gateway API Inference Extension builds on the existing Gateway API to add inference-specific routing capabilities, transforming gateways into "Inference Gateways" and enabling a model-as-a-service approach. This extension aims to standardize routing for inference workloads, allowing for model-aware routing, request prioritization, and optimized load balancing based on real-time metrics to reduce latency and improve GPU utilization.

The extension introduces two new Custom Resources: InferencePool, which manages resource deployment and balancing, and InferenceModel, which allows AI/ML owners to manage model endpoints and traffic policies. The request flow involves extra inference-aware steps, such as Endpoint Selection, to choose the most suitable pod for a request based on live metrics. Benchmarks show that the extension provides comparable throughput to standard Kubernetes services but with significantly lower latency. The roadmap for the extension includes features like prefix-cache aware load balancing, support for large multi-modal inputs/outputs, and heterogeneous accelerators. Overall, the Gateway API Inference Extension aims to simplify and standardize AI/ML traffic routing on Kubernetes, enhancing delivery of LLM services.
