## 🔹 Kubernetes - Kubernetes v1.34: Use An Init Container To Define App Environment Variables
The blog post discusses a new feature in Kubernetes v1.34, which allows the use of an init container to set environment variables for an application. Traditionally, ConfigMaps and Secrets are used for this, but they add complexity and additional API calls. The new (alpha) feature uses the `EnvFiles` feature gate, enabling the kubelet to load environment variables from a file in an `emptyDir` volume without mounting it into the container. This simplifies the process and avoids hard-coding or mounting volumes for environment variables like license keys or tokens. The post provides an example of how to implement this feature and highlights security considerations, emphasizing the need to protect nodes from unauthorized access. Overall, this feature aims to simplify app development and accommodate more use cases, while Kubernetes remains open to feedback for further improvement.

## 🔹 Docker - From Hallucinations to Prompt Injection: Securing AI Workflows at Runtime
The blog post titled "From Hallucinations to Prompt Injection: Securing AI Workflows at Runtime" discusses the importance of embedding runtime security in AI workflows to ensure safe development with AI agents. It highlights how AI tools, while powerful, are also unpredictable and susceptible to exploitation. For instance, when a large language model (LLM) is prompted to generate a Dockerfile or a shell script, the output may appear correct but could potentially introduce vulnerabilities if executed in development environments. The article emphasizes the need for developers to implement security measures to mitigate these risks and protect AI workflows from becoming attack surfaces.
