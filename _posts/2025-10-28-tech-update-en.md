## 🔹 Kubernetes - 7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)
The blog post titled "7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)" discusses common mistakes made while working with Kubernetes and provides tips on how to avoid them. The author shares personal experiences and insights into seven pitfalls, including skipping resource requests and limits; underestimating liveness and readiness probes; relying solely on container logs; treating development and production environments the same; leaving outdated resources in the cluster; diving too deep into networking too soon; and going too light on security and RBAC. Each section provides context, potential issues, and strategies to mitigate these problems, such as setting appropriate resource requests and limits, using centralized logging solutions, customizing configurations for different environments, and enforcing strict security practices. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding Kubernetes' core functionalities and learning from mistakes to improve cluster management and application performance.

## 🔹 Spring Boot - Prompt Caching Support in Spring AI with Anthropic Claude
The blog post discusses prompt caching in Spring AI with Anthropic Claude, which helps reduce API costs for applications that frequently send the same prompt content. Prompt caching allows for reusing previously processed segments, offering cost savings and latency reductions. Spring AI supports this feature by automating cache management through strategic caching patterns. The blog explains how prompt caching works, its benefits, and how to implement it using Spring AI. It also covers various caching strategies, such as caching system prompts, tools, and conversation history, and provides detailed examples and cost analyses. The post concludes by highlighting the advantages of prompt caching for reusable content and directs readers to further resources for more information.
