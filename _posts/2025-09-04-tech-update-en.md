## 🔹 Kubernetes - Kubernetes v1.34: Service Account Token Integration for Image Pulls Graduates to Beta
The blog post discusses the advancement of Kubernetes v1.34, where the "Service Account Token Integration for Image Pulls" feature has progressed to beta status. This feature aims to enhance security by minimizing the use of long-lived credentials and allowing credential providers to use workload-specific service account tokens to obtain registry credentials. This transition to beta introduces various changes, such as requiring the `cacheType` field, which must be specified in credential provider configurations to ensure proper caching behavior. The beta version also improves security by ensuring that pods can only access images pulled using authorized service accounts. The blog emphasizes the importance of feedback from the community, particularly from credential provider implementors, as the feature moves towards general availability. The post encourages community involvement and provides links for further information and participation in Kubernetes SIG Auth projects.

## 🔹 Docker - You are Doing MCP Wrong: 3 Big Misconceptions
The blog post titled "You are Doing MCP Wrong: 3 Big Misconceptions" addresses common misunderstandings about the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The author argues that many developers incorrectly perceive MCP as an API and mistakenly treat tools as agents, overlooking the broader capabilities of MCP beyond just tools. This misinterpretation can lead to flawed agent designs, hinder observability, and create challenges in integrating non-deterministic reasoning with deterministic execution. The post seeks to clarify these misconceptions and explain the practical implications of understanding MCP correctly.
