## 🔹 Kubernetes - Changes to Kubernetes Slack
The blog post announces that Kubernetes' Slack workspace will not be downgraded to a standard free account on June 20, 2025, as initially expected. Slack had supported Kubernetes with a free customized enterprise account for a decade, but due to its large size and activity, there was a plan to downgrade it. This would have imposed limitations like retaining only 90 days of history and disabling several apps and workflows. The community was advised to prepare by backing up information and considering a move to another platform, such as Discord, which offers better tools and integrations. However, since the workspace will not be downgraded, there's no immediate urgency for these actions. Details will be shared through official channels and discussions will continue on GitHub.
