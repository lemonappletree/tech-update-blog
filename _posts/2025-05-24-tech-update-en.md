## 🔹 Kubernetes - Kubernetes v1.33: In-Place Pod Resize Graduated to Beta
The blog post announces that the in-place Pod resize feature, also known as In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling, has been promoted to Beta in Kubernetes v1.33 and will be enabled by default. This feature allows for changing CPU and memory resources of running Pods without restarting them, reducing disruption for certain workloads and improving resource utilization. Since its initial alpha release in v1.27, the feature has undergone significant improvements, including a new `resize` subresource for modifying resources and support for resizing sidecar containers. The feature's stability and reliability have been enhanced, and it now integrates better with container runtimes. The blog also outlines future plans, such as integrating with VerticalPodAutoscaler and continuing to improve the feature's performance and reliability. Users are encouraged to experiment with the feature and provide feedback.
