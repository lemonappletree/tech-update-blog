## üîπ Kubernetes - Tuning Linux Swap for Kubernetes: A Deep Dive
The blog post discusses the NodeSwap feature in Kubernetes, introduced in Kubernetes v1.34, which enables swap usage on Linux nodes. This feature marks a significant departure from the traditional practice of disabling swap to ensure performance predictability. Swap allows Linux nodes to use secondary storage as additional virtual memory when physical RAM is full, potentially improving resource utilization and reducing out-of-memory (OOM) kills. However, correctly configuring Linux kernel parameters is crucial to avoid performance degradation and interference with Kubernetes' eviction logic. The article explores critical kernel parameters like `vm.swappiness`, `vm.min_free_kbytes`, and `vm.watermark_scale_factor`, explaining their roles in swap behavior and performance. The author conducted tests to evaluate the impact of these parameters, finding that proper tuning can prevent OOM kills and enhance system stability. Key recommendations include setting `vm.swappiness` to 60, `vm.min_free_kbytes` to 500MB, and `vm.watermark_scale_factor` to 2000, though these should be adjusted based on specific workload needs. Risks such as performance degradation, masking memory leaks, and disabling evictions are also highlighted, emphasizing the need for careful tuning.
